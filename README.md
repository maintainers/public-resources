----------------------------------------------------

## Welcome to the Open Source Maintainers organization
This is a space for maintainers to discuss experiences, challenges, and best practices in maintaining popular open source software (OSS) projects.

## How do I join?
This page is the public README for a private maintainers community. We’ve made it private to enable a free exchange of ideas, and we’re starting with a small group to ensure a good experience. 

## Public resources

- Best practices: [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide)
- OSS data for research: [Open Source Survey](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/)
- To help you get started as a contributor and convince your employers to participate in OSS: [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/)
